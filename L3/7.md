Okay, let's discuss load balancing strategies for an application hosted across internal and external zones, focusing on practical decisions and key technical considerations:

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Internal Zone:** Typically a private network within your organization, often for internal users and services, generally high-bandwidth and low latency.
*   **External Zone:** The public internet, often with users accessing your application from various locations and potentially lower bandwidth and higher latency.
*   **Load Balancing Goal:** Distribute traffic effectively, ensure availability, and optimize performance across both zones.
*   **Traffic Types:** Understand the types of traffic (e.g., user-facing, API calls, background jobs) and their characteristics for each zone.
*   **Latency Sensitivity:** Some traffic types might be more sensitive to latency than others.

**Key Load Balancing Strategies (and When to Use Them):**

1.  **Separate Load Balancers (Recommended for Most Cases):**

    *   **Concept:** Use distinct load balancers for internal and external traffic. This approach allows for independent configuration and scaling.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **External Load Balancer (Internet Facing):** A public-facing load balancer, often with features like SSL termination, WAF, and DDoS protection.
        *   **Internal Load Balancer:** A private load balancer for internal traffic, optimized for internal network performance.
    *   **Example:**
        *   External users connect to your application using a public-facing load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure Load Balancer). This load balancer distributes traffic to your external app instances.
        *   Internal users and internal services (within a VPC) connect through an internal load balancer, distributing traffic to your internal app instances.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Isolation:** Isolates external and internal traffic, improving security.
        *   **Independent Scaling:** You can scale external and internal instances independently based on demand.
        *   **Customization:** You can apply different settings for each load balancer to better meet its requirements.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **More Complex Configuration:** Requires more configuration, management overhead, and extra costs.
    *   **When To Use:** Most applications that need to balance user traffic from the internet and service traffic from internal networks.

2.  **Shared Load Balancer with Layer-7 Routing (Advanced):**

    *   **Concept:** Use a single load balancer with layer-7 routing rules to direct traffic based on host headers or other parameters.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   A single load balancer with multiple listeners, where each listener is configured for specific traffic types.
        *   Routing rules to direct traffic to different instance pools, depending on the request properties.
    *   **Example:**
        *   The same load balancer receives requests from internal and external users.
        *   Requests with a specific host header (e.g., `internal.example.com`) are routed to internal instances, while requests with other host headers (e.g., `example.com`) are routed to external instances.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Simplified Management:** Reduced number of load balancers, leading to simpler management overhead.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Security Concerns:** Requires stricter network policies to protect against internal access.
        *   **Complex Routing Rules:** Requires more complicated routing rules which might not be scalable.
        *   **Single Point of Failure:** Higher risk if the single load balancer fails.
        *   **Complexity in troubleshooting:** If there are issues on routing, it might be harder to identify the problem.
    *   **When To Use:** Limited internal/external traffic, strict budget constraints, or when there are only minor differences between internal and external traffic. Use this option when the internal application is basically the same as the external one.

3.  **DNS-Based Load Balancing (Simple, Limited Use):**

    *   **Concept:** Use DNS to direct users to different endpoints based on the zone.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Create different DNS records that point to different load balancers or app instances, based on the zone.
        *   External users will be routed to external endpoints via public DNS, and internal users will be routed to internal endpoints using internal DNS servers.
    *   **Example:**
        *   The DNS record `example.com` points to the public IP of external load balancer, when accessed externally.
        *   The DNS record `example.com` points to the private IP of the internal load balancer when accessed internally (using local DNS servers)
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Simplicity:** Easy to set up, requires no specific load balancing software.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Limited Flexibility:** Limited load balancing options.
        *   **No Health Checks:** Difficult to integrate health checks.
        *   **DNS Propagation Delays:** DNS changes might take time to propagate.
        *   **Not efficient:** DNS based load balancing is not as efficient as other solutions.
    *   **When To Use:** Very simple setups where high availability and intelligent routing are not critical.

**Key Decision Factors:**

*   **Security Requirements:** How strictly do internal and external traffic need to be separated? If there are strict requirements to separate data for security reasons, then having separate load balancers for each network might be better.
*   **Scalability:** How independently should external and internal instances scale? If there is a plan to scale each part independently, then separate load balancers might be better to manage.
*   **Traffic Patterns:** Are traffic patterns and bandwidth requirements similar or different in internal and external zones? If there are different requirements for bandwidth and traffic pattern in each zone, having separate load balancers is recommended.
*   **Cost:** What is the budget for infrastructure? Having a single load balancer is cheaper, but also have a single point of failure.
*   **Complexity:** How much complexity can the team manage effectively? Depending on the experience of the team, one approach might be more suitable than others.
*   **Maintenance and Troubleshooting:** Are there any specific needs that might require additional configuration and complex troubleshooting?

**Practical Considerations:**

*   **Network Configuration:** Ensure proper network configurations (e.g., subnets, firewall rules) for both internal and external zones.
*   **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring on both internal and external load balancers.
*   **Health Checks:**  Make sure health checks are configured properly for all services.
*   **CI/CD:** Integrate load balancer configuration into your CI/CD pipelines.

**In Summary:**

The best load balancing strategy depends on the specific needs of your application. Separating load balancers is often the most reliable, while a shared load balancer with L7 routing can be a good option for some cases. When choosing a solution, always start by defining what are the actual requirements of the system.
